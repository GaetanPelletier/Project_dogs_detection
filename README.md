# Project_dogs_detection
This is an educational project.

The aim of this project is to find a recent research paper (less than 18 months old). Then we have to use it to improve a model from our previous projects.

Here, I used *YOLOv4* and *YOLOv5* to improve the classification performance of the dog breed project (https://github.com/GaetanPelletier/Project_CNN_dog_breeds_classification).
In addition, these detection algorithms allowed us to add a new feature to our previous model: dog localization.
